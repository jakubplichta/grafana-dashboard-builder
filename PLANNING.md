## Development Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation (Weeks 1-2)
**Goal:** Establish modern Python foundation  
**Effort:** 15-20 hours  
**Priority:** CRITICAL

#### Key Deliverables
1. Remove Python 2 legacy code
2. Modernize import system in common.py
3. Migrate to pyproject.toml
4. Set up basic type hints

#### Success Metrics
- All `from __future__` imports removed
- Project builds with pyproject.toml
- No import errors with modern importlib

#### Risks & Mitigation
- **Risk:** Breaking changes for users on old Python versions
  - **Mitigation:** Clearly document minimum Python version in README and setup
- **Risk:** pyproject.toml migration breaks existing builds
  - **Mitigation:** Test thoroughly, keep setup.py as temporary shim

---

### Phase 2: Quality & Tooling (Weeks 3-4)
**Goal:** Implement quality assurance tools  
**Effort:** 20-25 hours  
**Priority:** HIGH

#### Key Deliverables
1. Add comprehensive type hints
2. Configure MyPy type checking
3. Set up pre-commit hooks
4. Organize imports consistently
5. Improve test coverage to 80%+

#### Success Metrics
- MyPy passes with strict mode
- All pre-commit hooks pass
- Test coverage >= 80%
- All imports properly organized

#### Risks & Mitigation
- **Risk:** Type hints reveal design issues
  - **Mitigation:** Refactor as needed, document breaking changes
- **Risk:** Low test coverage takes longer than estimated
  - **Mitigation:** Prioritize critical paths, accept 70% as minimum

---

### Phase 3: Documentation (Weeks 5-6)
**Goal:** Comprehensive documentation  
**Effort:** 15-20 hours  
**Priority:** HIGH

#### Key Deliverables
1. Add/improve docstrings for all public APIs
2. Create CONTRIBUTING.md
3. Create CHANGELOG.md
4. Enhance README with examples
5. Add issue/PR templates

#### Success Metrics
- All public functions have docstrings
- CONTRIBUTING.md covers setup, style, and process
- README has installation and usage examples
- CHANGELOG follows Keep a Changelog format

#### Risks & Mitigation
- **Risk:** Scope creep with documentation
  - **Mitigation:** Focus on public APIs first, internal docs later

---

### Phase 4: Refinement (Weeks 7-8)
**Goal:** Polish and enhance  
**Effort:** 15-20 hours  
**Priority:** MEDIUM

#### Key Deliverables
1. Implement structured logging
2. Review and enhance exception hierarchy
3. Add input validation
4. Security audit and fixes
5. Dependency updates

#### Success Metrics
- Bandit security scan passes
- All dependencies up to date
- Input validation covers all entry points
- Logging is consistent and informative

#### Risks & Mitigation
- **Risk:** Security issues require significant refactoring
  - **Mitigation:** Address critical issues, document medium/low priority ones

---

### Phase 5: Optimization (Weeks 9-12) - OPTIONAL
**Goal:** Performance and advanced features  
**Effort:** 20-30 hours  
**Priority:** LOW

#### Key Deliverables
1. Add performance benchmarks
2. Optimize CI/CD workflows
3. Add version management automation
4. Consider async support (if beneficial)

#### Success Metrics
- Baseline performance documented
- CI/CD runs < 5 minutes
- Version bumping automated

#### Risks & Mitigation
- **Risk:** Async refactor is too large
  - **Mitigation:** Make this truly optional, evaluate ROI first

## Resource Allocation

### Single Developer Timeline
- **Phase 1:** 2 weeks (part-time) or 4 days (full-time)
- **Phase 2:** 2 weeks (part-time) or 5 days (full-time)
- **Phase 3:** 2 weeks (part-time) or 4 days (full-time)
- **Phase 4:** 2 weeks (part-time) or 4 days (full-time)
- **Phase 5:** 4 weeks (part-time) or 6 days (full-time) - OPTIONAL

### Team of 2-3 Developers
- **Phase 1:** 1 week (parallelizable tasks: setup.py migration, legacy code removal)
- **Phase 2:** 1.5 weeks (parallelizable: type hints, tests, tooling)
- **Phase 3:** 1 week (parallelizable: different docs)
- **Phase 4:** 1 week (parallelizable: logging, validation, security)
- **Phase 5:** 2 weeks (optional)

**Total with team:** 4-6 weeks for Phases 1-4

---

## Technical Decisions

### Build System
**Decision:** Migrate to pyproject.toml  
**Rationale:** 
- Modern Python standard (PEP 517, 518, 621)
- Better tool integration
- Single source of truth for configuration

**Alternatives Considered:**
- Keep setup.py → Rejected: outdated, less maintainable
- Use Poetry → Rejected: adds another dependency, pyproject.toml is sufficient

---

### Type Checking
**Decision:** Use MyPy in strict mode  
**Rationale:**
- Industry standard
- Good IDE integration
- Can gradually increase strictness

**Alternatives Considered:**
- Pyright → Rejected: MyPy has better ecosystem
- No type checking → Rejected: Type safety is valuable

---

### Code Formatting
**Decision:** Use Black + isort  
**Rationale:**
- Black is opinionated, reduces bikeshedding
- isort handles imports specifically
- Both integrate well with pre-commit

**Alternatives Considered:**
- Ruff → Keep as option for future (can replace both + linting)
- Manual formatting → Rejected: inconsistent, wastes time

---

### Linting
**Decision:** Continue with existing linter, consider Ruff migration  
**Rationale:**
- Ruff is faster and can replace multiple tools
- Can migrate later if needed
- Current linting setup works

---

### Documentation Format
**Decision:** Google-style docstrings  
**Rationale:**
- More readable than reStructuredText
- Good Sphinx support
- Common in Python community

**Alternatives Considered:**
- NumPy style → Rejected: more verbose
- Sphinx style → Rejected: less readable

---

### Testing Framework
**Decision:** Continue with pytest  
**Rationale:**
- Already in use
- Industry standard
- Excellent plugin ecosystem

## Risk Management

### Technical Risks

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|-------------|--------|------------|
| Breaking API changes | Medium | High | Semantic versioning, deprecation warnings, migration guide |
| Type hints reveal design flaws | Medium | Medium | Refactor incrementally, document changes |
| Test coverage reveals bugs | High | Medium | Fix bugs as found, document in CHANGELOG |
| Performance regression | Low | Medium | Add benchmarks before major changes |
| Dependency conflicts | Low | Low | Pin versions, test thoroughly |

### Project Risks

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|-------------|--------|------------|
| Scope creep | Medium | High | Strict phase definitions, defer nice-to-haves |

## Decision Log

### Decision 1: Python Version Support
**Date:** TBD  
**Decision:** Support Python 3.8+  
**Rationale:** Python 3.7 EOL, 3.8 still widely used  
**Impact:** Must test on multiple Python versions

### Decision 2: Backward Compatibility
**Date:** TBD  
**Decision:** Break compatibility with Python 2, major version bump  
**Rationale:** Python 2 EOL since 2020, blocking modernization  
**Impact:** Document breaking changes, provide migration guide

### Decision 3: Async Support
**Date:** TBD  
**Decision:** Defer to Phase 5 or beyond  
**Rationale:** Significant effort, unclear immediate benefit  
**Impact:** Can be added later without breaking changes if designed well
